# Archiver for WinRT

Archiver for WinRT is a powerful utility for compressing and decompressing files and folders. Up until now, managing compressed files has been a huge pain in WinRT and Windows 8. Moreover, using the built-in mechanism, you couldn't compress a folder with its subfolders and files.

Archiver makes compressing and decompressing amazingly easy, using just two lines of code:

    Archiver archiver = new Archiver();
    archiver.Compress(source, destination);
        
Where source and destination are the specified files and folders. You can run the included demo and test by yourselves.

## Installation

The easiest way is to use Nuget, right from Visual Studio:

    PM> Install-Package archiver-winrt
    
Otherwise, you can download and build this project.

## Examples

First of all, include a reference to the assembly:

    using LightBuzz.Archiver;

### Compressing a single file

    private async void CompressFile()
    {
        FileOpenPicker filePickerSource = new FileOpenPicker();
        filePickerSource.FileTypeFilter.Add("*");
        filePickerSource.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.ComputerFolder;
    
        StorageFile source = await filePickerSource.PickSingleFileAsync();
    
        if (source != null)
        {
            FileSavePicker filePickerDestination = new FileSavePicker();
    
            filePickerDestination.FileTypeChoices.Add("Zip files (*.zip)", new List<string> { ".zip" });
            filePickerDestination.SuggestedFileName = "Backup";
            filePickerSource.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.ComputerFolder;
    
            StorageFile destination = await filePickerDestination.PickSaveFileAsync();
    
            if (destination != null)
            {
                Archiver archiver = new Archiver();
                archiver.Compress(source, destination);
            }
        }
    }
    
### Compressing a folder with its files and subfolders

    private async void CompressFolder()
    {
        FolderPicker folderPicker = new FolderPicker();
        folderPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add("*");
        folderPicker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.ComputerFolder;
    
        StorageFolder source = await folderPicker.PickSingleFolderAsync();
    
        if (source != null)
        {
            FileSavePicker filePicker = new FileSavePicker();
    
            filePicker.FileTypeChoices.Add("Zip files (*.zip)", new List<string> { ".zip" });
            filePicker.SuggestedFileName = "Backup";
            filePicker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.ComputerFolder;
    
            StorageFile destination = await filePicker.PickSaveFileAsync();
    
            if (destination != null)
            {
                Archiver archiver = new Archiver();
                archiver.Compress(source, destination);
            }
        }
    }
    
### Decompressing a zip file

    private async void Decompress()
    {
        FileOpenPicker filePicker = new FileOpenPicker();
        filePicker.FileTypeFilter.Add(".zip");
        filePicker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.ComputerFolder;
    
        StorageFile source = await filePicker.PickSingleFileAsync();
    
        if (source != null)
        {
            FolderPicker folderPicker = new FolderPicker();
            folderPicker.FileTypeFilter.Add("*");
            folderPicker.SuggestedStartLocation = PickerLocationId.ComputerFolder;
    
            StorageFolder destination = await folderPicker.PickSingleFolderAsync();
    
            if (destination != null)
            {
                Archiver archiver = new Archiver();
                archiver.Decompress(source, destination);
            }
        }
    }
    
That's it!
